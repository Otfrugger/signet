# honouring packages/spec/fixture-contracts/rust-toolchain.toml, stellar-cli
# (only `contract build` is used, never `optimize`), wabt (`wat2wasm`) and
# node (for the corrupt-section generator).
#
# `stellar contract optimize` is deliberately NOT run: optimization rewrites
# the module and would tie every fixture to the CLI version that ran it. The
# committed bytes are exactly what the SDK emitted, so a diff always means a
# source change and never a toolchain repackaging.
